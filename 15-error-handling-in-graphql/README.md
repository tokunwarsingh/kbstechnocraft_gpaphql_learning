# Episode 15: Optimizing GraphQL Performance

Welcome to **Episode 15** of the GraphQL Mastery Course! Today, we’ll explore strategies to improve the performance of your GraphQL API.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Identify common performance bottlenecks  
- Use DataLoader to batch and cache requests  
- Implement persisted queries  
- Enable response caching  

---

## 🔍 Common Bottlenecks

- N+1 query problem caused by nested resolvers  
- Large or complex queries taxing server resources  
- Frequent fetching of unchanged data  

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Use DataLoader for Batching and Caching

Recall DataLoader batches requests for the same resource in one go, reducing redundant calls.

###  
const DataLoader = require('dataloader');

const userLoader = new DataLoader(async (ids) => {
  // Batch fetch users by ids
});

## ⚙️ Step 2: Persisted Queries

Persisted queries store pre-approved queries on the server to reduce parsing overhead and improve security.

Example: Using Apollo Server with persisted queries enabled.

---

## 🛡️ Step 3: Response Caching

Cache frequent query responses using tools like `apollo-server-cache`.

---

## 🧠 Summary

- Batch and cache data fetching to avoid redundant calls  
- Use persisted queries to reduce parsing cost  
- Cache responses to improve latency and reduce load
